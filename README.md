# Fitness_Tracker

  
  ## Description 
  For this assignment, you'll create a workout tracker. You have already been provided with the front end code in the `develop` folder. This assignment will require you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.
  
  ## User Story
  
  As a:
   Fitness Enthusiast 
  
  I want to:
   be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.
   
  So that I can: 
   track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
